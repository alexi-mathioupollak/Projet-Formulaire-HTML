                <p>We are students from the IUT of Montpellier-Sète in Computer Science. Our project is to develop a website that allows users to generate forms in HTML code so that they only have to integrate them into the website. Drag and drop, and it's done.</p>

            <h1>We have put together a generator worthy of the name. Simple to use, responsive, efficient and fast, to receive an HTML code to integrate directly on your website.</h1>
            <p>To use our FRAJ-Form HTML form generator service, simply go to the "GENERATOR" page. There you will find a mini-tutorial to quickly and simply understand how it works. In principle, you can do it even without a tutorial!</p>
